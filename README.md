# Tomb Raider II Multiplayer Mod
 
This is a modification that implements multiplayer functionalities to the game Tomb Raider II using C++17.

This project has two dependencies, [SlikeNet](https://www.slikesoft.com/) and [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook). Compiled library binaries must be placed in the following directory: **"SolutionDir\deps\libs\"** .

Must be compiled in 32 (x86) bits because the modifications are carried out using the client as a DLL.

Credits to SlikeNet, MinHook and [Arsunt](https://github.com/Arsunt/TR2Main) whose project helped me reversing some game structures and functions.

**NOTE: This project is just an early testing version of the mod, there are a few bugs when synchronizing entities such as vehicles and doors. Besides those bugs, the mod can be completely used to play and complete the game with friends.**
